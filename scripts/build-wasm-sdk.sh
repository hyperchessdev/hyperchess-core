#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-wasm-sdk.sh — compile crates/hyperchess-wasm to WebAssembly for the
# @hyperchess/wasm SDK package (packages/wasm/).
#
# Adapted from the source repo's scripts/build-wasm-sdk.sh, which built
# src/hyperchess directly (there was no separate wasm crate there — see
# docs/hyperchess-core-extraction-plan.md §12 Phase 6 for why this repo has
# one). Unlike the source script, no --no-default-features/--features wasm
# flags are needed: crates/hyperchess-wasm gates its wasm-bindgen code by
# `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`, not a Cargo feature, so targeting wasm32
# via wasm-pack's --target flag is sufficient on its own.
#
# Targets:
#   - bundler: for apps that import @hyperchess/wasm through webpack/vite/etc.
#   - nodejs:  for server-side consumers (e.g. an HTMX backend)
#   - web:     for consumers who want a plain <script type="module"> import
#              with no bundler
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-wasm-sdk.sh
#
# Requires: wasm-pack and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target
#   cargo install wasm-pack
#   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
