# @hyperchess/theme

Board themes and styling for [HyperChess](https://github.com/hyperchessdev/hyperchess-core) —
color palettes and piece styling for the 12×12 board, consumed by
[`@hyperchess/board`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperchess/board) and usable standalone.

```js
import { THEME_CLASSIC, getTheme, applyTheme } from '@hyperchess/theme';

// Five built-in themes: classic, modern, dark, highcontrast, pastel
const theme = getTheme('dark');

// Apply as CSS custom properties on any element
applyTheme(document.querySelector('#board'), theme);
```

A `Theme` is a plain object (`lightSquare`, `darkSquare`, move/selection highlights, piece style,
coordinate color) — spread a built-in theme to customize it:

```js
const myTheme = { ...THEME_CLASSIC, darkSquare: '#4a7c59' };
```

No runtime dependencies.
