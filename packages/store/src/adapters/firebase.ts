/**
 * Firebase Firestore adapter for real-time multiplayer
 * Requires: npm install firebase
 *
 * Features:
 * - Real-time updates via onSnapshot
 * - Server-side count (getCountFromServer) with client fallback
 * - Batched deletes (respects Firestore's 500-op batch limit)
 *
 * Schema assumption: a single top-level `games` collection whose document id is
 * the game id, so `id` is never stored as a field. Fields are camelCase and
 * written as native Firestore values — `players` and `metadata` are nested maps
 * rather than JSON strings, unlike the SQL adapters. Timestamps are ISO 8601
 * strings, not Firestore `Timestamp`s, which keeps ordering lexicographic and
 * comparable across backends.
 *
 * Composite queries (`listGames` with a filter plus `orderBy('createdAt')`)
 * require matching composite indexes in the project's Firestore configuration;
 * without them Firestore rejects the query at runtime.
